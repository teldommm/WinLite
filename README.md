## WinNative: A Community Built Windows Emulation App for Android

**WinNative** is an advanced, high-performance Windows (x86_64) emulation environment for Android. It bridges the gap between desktop gaming and mobile by unifying the best technologies from **Winlator Bionic** and **Pluvia**.

Designed for enthusiasts and power users, WinNative delivers the full Winlator experience while making it easy to connect your Steam game library.

---

### Installation

1. **Download:** Get the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/WinNative-Emu/WinNative/releases) section.
2. **Setup:** Launch the app, allow the ImageFS to install, and start adding your games manually or sync your library. 

---

### How to Build

**Requirements:** Android Studio, JDK 17, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com), the NDK
(`27.3.13750724`) and CMake for the native build.

1. **Clone with submodules and pull LFS objects** (Required):
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/MaxsTechReview/WinNative.git
   cd WinNative
   git lfs pull                          # fetches imagefs
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. **Build via Android Studio:** Open the `WinNative` directory, let Gradle sync, then select **Build > Build APK(s)**.
3. **Build via CLI:** Run `./gradlew assembleStandardDebug` (or `.\gradlew.bat` on Windows).

### Frame Generation

WinNative can interpolate extra frames between the ones your game actually renders, using the
Lossless Scaling frame generation shaders. Interpolation runs **on the Android side**, inside
WinNative's own Vulkan compositor rather than inside the Wine container, so it works with any
graphics API Wine can drive — DXVK, WineD3D or native Vulkan alike.

**You must own [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/) on Steam.** Its shaders are
not redistributable, so nothing ships with the APK. WinNative reads them out of your own copy of
`Lossless.dll`, translates them from DXBC to SPIR-V once, and caches the result in app storage.
The DLL is parsed as data and never executed.

**Setup:** sign in to Steam, install Lossless Scaling, then open **Container Settings → Frame
Generation**. WinNative finds the DLL automatically from your Steam library; if it can't, use
**Select Lossless.dll…** to point at it. The in-game **FG** tab stays disabled until the shaders
import successfully.

**In-game controls** live in the **FG** tab of the session drawer, between HUD and Gyro:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Generate Frames | Master toggle |
| Adaptive Target | Aim for a specific output rate (60/90/120/144/165) instead of a fixed multiplier |
| Multiplier | 2× / 3× / 4× — generated frames per rendered frame |
| Flow Scale | 25–100%, resolution of the optical-flow pyramid; lower is cheaper and softer |
| FPS Limiter | Caps the game's own frame rate, from 15 fps upward |

**What to expect.** Frame generation costs **one extra frame of input latency** — interpolating
between two frames means holding the newer one back. It also needs spare display refresh:
generated frames occupy vblanks, so WinNative sizes the multiplier against your panel's refresh
rate and the game's actual frame rate, and will hand back generated frames rather than take real
ones from the game. A game already running near your panel's refresh rate has nothing to gain.
Pairing a multiplier with an FPS limiter that divides the refresh rate evenly (120 Hz with a
60 fps cap at 2×, or 40 at 3×) gives the most even pacing.

#### Frame generation — what came from Eden

WinNative's frame generation exists because the [Eden Emulator Project](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden)
had already solved the hard part: getting the Lossless Scaling compute chain running correctly
on Vulkan, on mobile GPUs. The port here started from Eden's work and still carries it. Their
copyright notices are preserved in every file that derives from them, under GPL-3.0-or-later.

Derived from Eden (jointly with **[lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk)**, which Eden
themselves ported from):

| Source file | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `lsfg_chain.*` | The shape of the whole chain — which of the 25 shaders run, in what order, and what each stage feeds the next |
| `lsfg_mipmaps.*` | The flow pyramid the rest of the chain is built on |
| `lsfg_alpha.*` | Per-level feature extraction, including the batched-barrier dispatch pattern the rest of the chain follows |
| `lsfg_beta.*` | The coarse flow estimate the refinement stages start from |
| `lsfg_gamma.*` | Coarse-to-fine flow refinement, one instance per pyramid level |
| `lsfg_delta.*` | The extra refinement and detail passes on the finest levels |
| `lsfg_generate.*` | The final warp that produces the interpolated frame |
| `lsfg_common.*` | The Vulkan plumbing all of the above sit on — image, sampler and buffer wrappers, the barrier builder, the descriptor writer, and the pass/pipeline helper |

Derived from Eden specifically:

| Source file | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `lsfg_pacer.*` | Deciding how many frames to generate per real frame |
| `lsfg_shaders.*` | Turning the extracted shader blobs into Vulkan shader modules |

Getting the descriptor layouts, barrier placement and dispatch geometry of a 25-shader chain
right is not something you arrive at by reading the shaders; it is the part that takes the
debugging. Eden did that work, and this port would not have been possible without it.

What WinNative added on top is the Windows and Android side of it: reading the shader blobs out
of a user's own Lossless Scaling install (`lsfg_dll.*`), translating them when only DXBC is
available (`lsfg_dxbc.*`), the JNI surface (`lsfg_jni.*`), driver probing (`lsfg_probe.*`), and
wiring the chain into WinNative's compositor and swapchain (`vkr_lsfg.*`).
