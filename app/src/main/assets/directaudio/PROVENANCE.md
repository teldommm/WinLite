# DirectAudio driver binaries — provenance

The `.zip` files in this directory are **unmodified release artifacts** downloaded
verbatim from the upstream project — the shipped bytes match the checksums below.

**On-device modification (LGPL-2.1 §2 disclosure).** At install time WinNative
renames one entry in the unixlib's dynamic section: `winedirectaudio.so`'s
`DT_NEEDED` string `libaaudio.so` is rewritten in place to `libwaudio.so` (same
length). `libaaudio.so` is a public Android soname that bionic force-resolves from
the system namespace, whose framework closure the Wine unixlib namespace cannot
link, so the stock unixlib fails to load. `libwaudio.so` is a small AAudio bridge
supplied by WinNative (its own code, not derived from this driver) that forwards
the 27 `AAudio_*` entry points to the real `/system/lib64/libaaudio.so` through a
platform-linked namespace. The corresponding source for a driver that needs no such
rename — the AAudio bridge folded into the unixlib itself — is at
https://github.com/WinNative-Emu/directaudio (branch `winnative/self-contained-aaudio`).

Each archive is the complete 3-file driver set:

```
aarch64-windows/winedirectaudio.drv   arm64ec PE  — loaded for 64-bit guest games
i386-windows/winedirectaudio.drv      32-bit PE   — loaded for wow64 guest games
aarch64-unix/winedirectaudio.so       bionic unixlib — the AAudio backend
```

`wine10` matches Proton 10.0-4; `wine11` serves Proton 11.0-1 / 11.0-3 / 11.0-5 /
11.0-6 (ABI-interchangeable). `sdk28` is built for 4 KB kernel pages, `sdk35` for
16 KB — `DirectAudioDriver.pageSizeTag()` picks between them at runtime.

## Picking between the two builds

The two builds differ only in the **mmdevapi unixlib ABI** they were compiled
against, which is observable in the shipped binary: the `__wine_unix_call_funcs`
table in `aarch64-unix/winedirectaudio.so` holds **36** entries in the `wine10`
build and **37** in the `wine11` build. Every Proton ships `winealsa.so` with the
same table, so `DirectAudioDriver` reads the entry count out of the Proton layer
and picks the build that matches, rather than parsing a version out of the
profile name. Measured:

| Proton (arm64ec) | `winealsa.so` entries | build selected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9.0 (bundled) | 36 | `wine10` |
| 10.0-4 | 36 | `wine10` |
| 11.0-x, incl. our 11.0-2 | 37 | `wine11` |

Note the `wine10`/`wine11` names are historical: the wine10 build also serves
Proton 9.0. A Proton whose table matches neither build is refused and the launch
falls back to the default audio driver.

The `.drv` PE halves carry no export table in the wine11 build. That is **normal
for Wine 11** — its own `winealsa.drv` and `winepulse.drv` are byte-for-byte the
same shape (identical `.text`/`.rdata`/`.pdata` sizes, importing only
`ucrtbase.dll` and `kernel32.dll`), because in Wine 11 the `.drv` is a generic
unixlib host and all the driver logic lives in the `.so`. Do not read the missing
exports as a broken artifact.

## Source availability (LGPL-2.1 §6)

The corresponding source for these binaries is the upstream repository above at tag
`directaudio-v1.3.2`. Because the driver links Wine's LGPL mmdevapi internals, the
Wine tree it was built against forms part of the corresponding source; see the
upstream `INTEGRATION.md` for the build recipe. The driver is loaded dynamically by
Wine's own loader and can be replaced by dropping a different build into the
container's `lib/wine/` directories, which satisfies the relinking requirement.
